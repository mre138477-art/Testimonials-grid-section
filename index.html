                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
                    in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.

“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program

  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ”
